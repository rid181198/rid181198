### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m Ridhesh. I like to program stuff, solve problems, work on big datasets, and build ML models and web applications. This GitHub profile 
includes some of the projects I worked on. Besides that, I love sports, cycling, painting, and chess in my free time.

I want to mention the key highlighted projects: Flask stock prediction app, Flask market, GoDaddy micro business density
prediction, and Galaxy morphology classification. Please checkout and let's connect.
