### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about Data science methods and its implementation on real life applications, (also in Astrophysics). I have already worked on machine learning algorithms for classification, regression, clsutering models. Besides that, I also learned about the neural network models like CNN, RNN for both image classification and text classification in NLP. Mainly, I work on python and Jupyter Notebook.

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects related to business, health, medical and astrophysics related topics.
